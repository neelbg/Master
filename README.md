# Master Practical.
I was given task named master practical , in which i had to create a ecommerce webiste page from scratch . The page contained wishlist menu , dropdown menu , swatches ,
pagination,filtering the product options etc.
For these task i have used html , css , bootstrap & javascript.
In add to cart menu price change with increase in product number & filtering part is pending.
I have used google chrome & mozila firefox browser for checking the functionality of the web page.
Note :- I have kept console to let the senior developer know that the fucntionality is working i just didn't know how to display it on the page.
